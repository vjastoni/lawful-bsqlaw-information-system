            &nbsp; was founded by three law partners, Dickson, Gilbert and
            Bayan, who worked together at a major Makati law firm. After a
            combined twenty five years of legal practice, they decided to
            establish a law firm, more grounded on their shared values and a
            deeper concern for their clients.
