            &nbsp; was founded by three law partners, Dickson, Gilbert
            and Bayan, who worked together at a major Makati law firm.
            After a combined twenty five years of legal practice, they
            decided to establish a law firm, more grounded on their
            shared values and a deeper concern for their clients.
